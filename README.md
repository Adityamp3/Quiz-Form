# Quiz Project

This project is a simple quiz application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- `style.css`: This file contains the CSS styles that are applied to the quiz. It defines the layout, colors, and other visual aspects of the quiz.

- `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code that handles the logic of the quiz. It manages the user's answers, calculates the score, and displays the results.
